# OptimIT.Dashboard

Following the amazing work of [@DustinBryant](https://github.com/DustinBryant/WpfDashboardControl/commits?author=DustinBryant) in 
[DustinBryant/WpfDashboardControl](https://github.com/DustinBryant/WpfDashboardControl) A nuget package is really needed, also for adding more features, because the given example in the original repository is following MVVM and hardly coupled with the demo. so I wanted to separate things a little bit. Enjoy !!!
